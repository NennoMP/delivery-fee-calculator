## Overview
The application is implemented with a monolith-based architecture and is completely Dockerized.Â 

In order to create OpenAPI documentation for the APIs, Swagger and Connexion framework were used. The application should be running on **localhost:5000 (127.0.0.1:5000)** and the Swagger interface, which allows to analyze and test the endpoints simply from the web-browser, can be accessed at **localhost:5000/ui (127.0.0.1:5000/ui)**.

Some **CI/CD tools (CircleCI, Codecov)** were used in order to build and test the project, as can be seen from the above badges, and, from a security point of view, the application was tested with **Bandit** (static vulnerabilities' analysis).

## Instructions
You can decide to test/run the application with or without Docker, notice that if you're on Windows you **MUST** run the application with Docker (since `time.tzset()` is available only on Unix).
Below you can find a short tutorial for both approaches.
### Run the application (Docker version)

If you want to run the application with Docker, make sure you have Docker Desktop running (if you are on Windows) and follow these steps:

1. Go on the project's root
2. Build the project with `docker-compose build`
3. Run the application with `docker-compose up`

### Run the application (Flask version)

If you want to run the application without Docker, you have to follow these steps:

1. Go on the project's root
2. Create a virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`
3. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` or `source venv/scripts/activate`
4. Install all requirements needed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the script `run.sh` with `bash run.sh`

### Testing the application
The application is already tested with CI/CD tools. However, if you would like to manually run the application's tests, follow the steps below.

If you have not yet created a virtual environment and installed the requirements:
1. Go on the project's root
2. Create a virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`
3. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` or `source venv/scripts/activate`
4. Install all requirements needed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now simply execute the `pytest` command. The testing is set to fail if the coverage is not above 90%.
